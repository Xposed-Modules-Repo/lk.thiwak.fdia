## Installation
- Download the latest release (or a version compatible with your target app).
- Install the APK on your Android device.
- Activate the module in LSPosed (or your preferred Xposed manager).
- Force stop the target app and relaunch it, or reboot the device.

## Usage Notes
- Confirm the module is enabled in LSPosed (and set to run in the appropriate process. Sometimes app-specific activation may be required).
- If a patched app updates, you may need to re-check compatibility or update FDia.
- If something breaks, disable the module and reboot to revert behavior.

## Troubleshooting
- App still fails integrity checks
  - Ensure FDia is enabled for the app's process
  - Force stop relevant app/apps and open again
  - Reboot the device if still failing
- Module causing instability? 
  - Disable FDia in LSPosed/Xposed manager and you may need to reboot
  - Then open an issue with logs/screenshots and steps to reproduce
- Error loading page (Error Code : 3)
  - Disable your `SSL-Unpinner` and try again
